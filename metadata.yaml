description: How the Other Half Lives was a pioneering work of photojournalism by
  Jacob Riis, documenting the squalid living conditions in New York City slums in
  the 1880s. It served as a basis for future muckraking journalism by exposing the
  slums to New York City's upper and middle class. How The Other Half Lives quickly
  became a landmark in the annals of social reform. Riis documented the filth, disease,
  exploitation, and overcrowding that characterized the experience of more than one
  million immigrants. He helped push tenement reform to the front of New York's political
  agenda, and prompted then-Police.
